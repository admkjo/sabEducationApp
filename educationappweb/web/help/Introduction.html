<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">Sabonay Education is a software package that aims to computerize all aspects of record keeping activities of a school. It has evolved over the years and it is constantly evolving to incorporate new ideas and features which will ultimately make Sabonay Education a better school software.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">One remarkable thing about Sabonay Education is that, the development process has always been done with close collaboration with school administrators and all potential system users such as class teachers and IT administrators. This collaboration has made Sabonay Education one of the most trusted school management systems in the country.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">Sabonay Education is </span><span class="rvts18">NOT FOR SALE</span><span class="rvts6">. It is only given out to schools on subscription bases. Usually an initial token amount is paid ONLY once for the installation, configuration and training of staff to use the software. Then for subsequent academic terms, the school pays a termly subscription and support fees, subject to change every academic year, depending on changes in national economic factors.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">Services and support to schools that have signed on to Sabonay Education is second to none and can be confirmed with schools that have signed on to the product. Support is usually given in the form of emails, phone call, and physical presence of Sabonay Technologies personnel depending on the nature of support and services requested.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">New features and recommendation about the software functionality are always welcomed from clients since we believe it is the best and only way to develop a product that would best suites the needs of our cherished customers. As a matter of fact, well over fifty percent (50%) of all features and functionality have come from client suggestions and we are always grateful for their contribution on their input and suggestions.</span></p>
